[Verse 1]
Broken down headlights
My car is down again
I think I missed your flight
You know I'll long
The boring nights
We used to rock
Just remembered I was at the spot
Unknown dead ends
We were all that
You know I'll long

[Refrain]
I must have passed out last night
I'm still fumbling with your memories
About the last time we tried
When our worlds were falling away from us
I know, I know, oh, I know (Oh-oh)
I know, I know, oh, I know (Oh-oh)
Now here you are, alone again
And it spins me right around

[Chorus]
This merry go
You don't know what you've done to me
You don't know what you've done
You don't know what you've done to me
And now you got me, merry go
You don't know what you've done to me
You don't know what you've done
You don't know what you've done to me
And now you got me

[Verse 2]
The fire drowns me inside
Now, darling, I'm a mess
And I've been here too many times
Just to know I'll miss your
Boring nights
Where we used to rock
Just remembered I was at your spot
Unknown dead ends
I want it all back

[Chorus]
On this merry go
You don't know what you've done to me
You don't know what you've done
You don't know what you've done to me
And now you got me, merry go
You don't know what you've done to me
You don't know what you've done
You don't know what you've done to me
And now you got me

[Bridge]
Have I made it any further?
Told you I was being nervous
You know I didn't mean to murder
The moments had with you
Now I left you for the show
Told myself I'm better off alone
Never been the same since I let go
Don't you know it sends me back around this

[Outro]
Merry go?
Merry go
Merry go
Merry go
